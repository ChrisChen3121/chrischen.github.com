* Definition
  A computer program is said to learn from experience *E* with respect to some task *T*
  and some performance measure *P*, if its performance on *T*, as measured by *P*, impoves
  with experience *E* -- Tom Mitchell(1998)

* Supervised
  Teach the computer how to do something
  - "right answers" given

** Regression problem
   predict continuous valued output

** Classification problem
   predict discrete valued output

* Unsupervised
  Let computer learn by itself

** Clustering problem
*** Examples
    - Social network analysis
    - Market segmentation(categorize customers)
    - Astronomical data analysis

** Non-clustering problem
*** Cocktail party algorithm

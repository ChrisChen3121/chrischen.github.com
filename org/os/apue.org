* File I/O
  - open, openat, creat
  - close
  - ~ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count)~
  - ~ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t nbytes)~

** bufsize
   Most file systems support some kind of read-ahead to improve performance. When
   sequential reads are detected, the system tries to read in more data than an application
   requests, assuming that the application will read it shortly.

** Attributes
- /sid/: A session is a collection of process groups (jobs). All of the processes in a session have the same session identifier.
A session leader is the process that created the session, and its process ID becomes the session ID.
- /gid/: Each process in a process group has the same integer process group identifier, which is the same as the process
ID of one of the processes in the group, termed the process group leader.

** Background Jobs
   A session can have any number of background process groups(background jobs), which are created by terminating a command with the ampersand ~&~ character.

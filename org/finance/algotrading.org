* Impact-driven
 TWAP and VWAP are first generation of impact-driven algorithms, their main focus is their respective benchmarks.

** TWAP
   - predictable way
   - considerable signalling risk
   - the only thing other participants do not know is the total size of order

*** randomize
    - avoid unfavourable market conditions(small best bid/offer sizes, large price jumps)
    - increasing the risk of missing the TWAP benchmark

*** variations
**** aggressive/passive factor
    - a aggressive approach issue more orders early on, help reduce timing risk
    - a passive approach should result in lower market impact costs

**** price adaptive
     adjust the trading schedule dynamically based on the market price(a simple price inline algorithm)

*** parameters
**** tracking
     limit how far it may go ahead(or behind) schedule(pecentage or a cash value)

**** interval frequency
     use randommisations

** VWAP
   - use historical volume profiles. $avg_period/avg_total$
   - condition: the day's trading volume follows a similar pattern to the historical profile
   - modern VWAP determine whether they may get ahead of schedule, and how best to catch up if they are behind their target
   - performance: 1. how well they track the target; 2.how well they predict market volume

*** variations
   - vulnerable to sudden shifts, some versions may monitor current market conditions
   - some variants tracks short-term price and volume trends and dynamically adjusts their target execution profile accordingly

*** parameters
**** tracking
     control over how closely they track the target completion profile via custom parameters or an execution style parameter

**** start/end

**** trending/tilting
     some versions may provide parameters that let the target execution profile be tilted towards either the start or the end of the day

** POV(Percent of Volume)
   - also called volume inline, participation, target volume or follow algorithms
   - tracking a participation rate: a 20% participation rate of 100,000 total should execute 20,000
   - keep in line with the observed volume

*** adjust our participation rate
    to account for our own trading. e.g. to track participation rate 20% for 1000 executed
    - $Participation rate = 200/(1000+200) = 16.667%$, not right
    - adjustment $1/(1-p)$. e.g $1/(1-0.2) = 25%$ of each observed new trade
    - $Participation rate = 250/(1000+250) = 20%$

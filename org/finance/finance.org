* Conceptions
** VAR(value at risk)
   *Value at risk* is usually quoted in units of $ for a given probability and time horizon

   Ex: 1% one-year VAR of $10 million means 1% chance that a portfolio will lose $10 million in a year

** Stress Tests
   The stress test is a test usually ordered by government to see
   how some firm will stand up to a financial crisis.

** Cauchy Distribution
   Fat-tailed

** Random Walk
   $$x_t=x_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t$$
*** First-order autoregressive(AR-1) Model
    $$x_t=100+\rho(x_{t-1}-100)+\varepsilon_t$$
    Mean reverting (to 100), $-1<\rho <1$

* Strategy Benchmark
** Expected return
   $$return = \frac{value_{end}}{value_{start}} - 1 $$
*** long-period return 2 short-period avg return(using geomean)
    Number of period is denoted by *n*.
    $$short\_avg = \sqrt[n]{1+total\_return} - 1$$

** Daily return
   $$rets_i = \frac{value_i}{value_{i-1}} - 1 $$

** Sharpe ratio
   $$Sharpe = \frac{E - R_f}{\sigma} $$
   - $R_f$: risk free return
*** from period returns
    $$Sharpe = sqrt(k) * \frac{mean(period\_rets)}{std(period\_rets)}$$
    - k: trading periods in one year. 250 for days, 12 for month
** Sortino ratio
   only count volatility when it's downward

** Max drawdown
** Jensen's alpha
* Company Value
** Market Capital
** Discount Ratio(present value)
** Book Value
   A company's book value is its total assets minus intangible assets and liabilities

** Gordon Model
   The idea is the price of stock should be the present discount value of expected dividends.
   - if earning equal dividends and if dividends grow at long-run rate $g$, then by growing
   consol model $P=\frac{E}{r-g}$, $P/E=\frac{1}{r-g}$ ($r$ for discount rate)

* CAPM
** Return on stock has two components
   $$r_i = \beta_i \cdot r_m + \alpha_i$$
*** Systematic(the market) $\beta$
*** Residual $\alpha$
** Market return
   Risk free rate of return + excess return
* Efficient Markets Hypothesis
** Weak
   Current prices reflect all past publicly available information.
   - Prohibits profit from T.A
** Semi-Strong
   Weak + prices instantly change to reflect new public information
   - Prohibits profit from T.A & F.A
** Strong
   Semi-Strong + prices instantly reflect even hidden or "insider" information
   - Prohibits profit from insider information
* Analysis
** Technical Analysis
   - Prices and volume only
** Fundamental Analysis
   - Financial statements
   - P/E ratios, cash on hand, dividends
* Information Source
  - Price/Volume: The markets
  - Fundamental: SEC filings
  - News: Exogenous sources
* Insurance
** Risk Pooling
   *Risk Pooling* is the source of all value in insurance.

   If *n* policies, each has independent probability *p* of a claim,
   then the number of claims follows the binomial distribution. The
   standard deviation of the fraction of policies that result in a claim is
   $\frac{\sqrt{np(1-p)}}{n}=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$
* Bonds
** Inflation-indexed Debt
   - eg: TIPS(iShares TIPS Bond ETF)
* Money
** Three functions it provides:
   - a store of value
   - a unit of account
   - a medium of transaction
* Behavioral Finance
** Expected Utility Theory(1738 old)
   Two ideas:
   1. An investor's acceptance of risk should incorporate not only the possible losses that can occur,
   but also the utility, or intrinsic value, of the investment itself
   2. *marginal utility*: The same amount of additional money was less useful to
   an already-wealthy person than it would be to a poor person.

** Prospect Theory(1970)
   People decide which outcomes they consider equivalent, set a reference point
   and then consider lesser outcomes as losses and greater ones as gains

   Prospect theory assumes that losses and gains are valued differently,
   and thus individuals make decisions based on perceived gains instead of perceived losses

   $$V=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w(p_i)v(o_i)$$
   $o_i$ for outcome, $p_i$ for probability of particular outcome.
   $w(x)$ is the weighting function, $v(x)$ is the value function.
   $U$ is the overall or expected utility of the outcomes to the individual making the decision.

*** Certainty Effect
    The psychological effect of winning a reward is result from the reduction of
    probability from certainty to probable. (see weighting function)

*** Reflection Effect
    The reversing of risk-aversion/risk-seeking in case of gains or losses.
    People are risk-aversion in case of gains, and vice versa.

*** Disposition Effect
    Disposition effect is the tendency for investors to hold on to losing stocks
    for too long and sell winning stocks too soon.

*** Reference Dependence
*** Loss Aversion
    refers to people's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains

** Overconfidence Theory
** Cognitive Dissonance
   Mental conflict that occurs when one learns one's beliefs are wrong, avoidance behavior.

   refers to a situation involving conflicting attitudes, beliefs or behaviors.
   This produces a feeling of discomfort leading to an alteration in one of the attitudes,
   beliefs or behaviors to reduce the discomfort and restore balance, etc.

   Festinger's (1957) cognitive dissonance theory suggests that we have an inner drive to hold
   all our attitudes and beliefs in harmony and avoid disharmony (or dissonance). This is known
   as the principle of cognitive consistency

   - Ads for recently purchased cars
   - Disposition effect

** Mental Compartments
   Humans have a tendency to place particular events into mental compartments and
   the difference between these compartments sometimes impacts our behavior more
   than the events themselves
   - overfocus on the small part of the portfolio

** Attention Anomalies
   - social basis of attention

     may everyone pay attention to some stock -> overpriced

** Anchoring
   - wheel of fortune experiment
   - Stock prices anchored to past values, or to other stock prices in same field.

** Representativeness Heuristic
   - Tendency to see patterns in what is really random walk
   - Stock price manipulators try to create patterns to fool investors

** Disjunction Effect
   Inability to make a decision that is contingent on future information
   - Reaction of stock market to news, make stock strategies to trade on news

** Social Cognition
   The spread of ideas, attitudes, or behaviour patterns in a group through imitation and conformity.

** Framing Effect
   People react to a particular choice in different ways depending on how it is presented

** Magical Thinking
   Experiment: fed hungry pigeons mechanically. Pigeons developed superstitions.
   - Stock market responses to events may have similar origins
*** Quasi Magical Thinking
    - Newcomb's Paradox
    - People bet more on coin not yet tossed.

** Culture and Social Contagion
   - Tendency to adopt beliefs of other people

** Antisocial Personality Disorder & Borderline Personality Disorder

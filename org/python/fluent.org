* Philosophy
- EAFP(python way)

Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. This common Python coding style assumes the existence of valid keys
or attributes and catches exceptions if the assumption proves false. This clean and fast style is characterized by
the presence of many try and except statements. The technique contrasts with the LBYL style common to many other
languages such as C.

- LBYL(contrast with EAFP)

Look before you leap. This coding style explicitly tests for pre-conditions before making calls or lookups. This
style contrasts with the EAFP approach and is characterized by the presence of many if statements. In a multi-threaded
environment, the LBYL approach can risk introducing a race condition between “the looking” and “the leaping”.
For example, the code, if key in mapping: return mapping[key] can fail if another thread removes key from mapping
after the test, but before the lookup. This issue can be solved with locks or by using the EAFP approach.

   #+END_SRC

* Iterator
** Compare with Iterable
  - Iterator is a Iterable, they both have a ~__iter__~ method
  - In addition, Iterator has a ~__next__~ method
  - Iterator ~__iter__~ often return itself

* Functional Programming
** Filtering
    - built-in ~filter~
    - ~filterfalse(predicate, it)~
    - ~islice(it, stop) or islice(it, start, stop, step=1)~
    - ~compress(it, selector_it)~: Consumes two iterables in parallel; yields items from it whenever the corresponding item in selector_it is truthy
    - ~dropwhile(predicate, it)~: Consumes it skipping items while predicate computes truthy, then yields every remaining item
    - ~takewhile(predicate, it)~: Yields items while predicate computes truthy, then stops

** Mapping
    - built-in ~enumerate(iterable, start=0)~
    - built-in ~map(func, it1, [it2, …, itN])~
    - ~accumulate(it, [func])~: Yields accumulated sums(default); if func is provided, yields the result of applying it to the first pair of items, then to the first result and next item
    - ~starmap(func, it)~: Applies func to each item of it, yielding the result; the input iterable should yield iterable items iit, and func is applied as func(*iit)

** Merging Multiple Inputs
    - ~chain(it1, …, itN)~
    - ~chain.from_iterable(it)~: Yield all items from each *iterable* produced by it, one after the other, seamlessly
    - ~product(it1, …, itN, repeat=1)~: *Cartesian product*; yields N-tuples made by combining items from each input iterable like nested for loops could produce; *repeat* allows the input iterables to be consumed more than once.
    - (built-in) ~zip(it1, …, itN)~~: Silently stopping when the first iterable is exhausted
    - ~zip_longest(it1, …, itN, fillvalue=None)~: Stopping only when the last iterable is exhausted, filling the blanks with the fillvalue

** Rearranging
    - ~groupby(it, key=None)~: Yields 2-tuples of the form (key, group)
    - ~reversed(seq)~
    - ~tee(it, n=2)~: Yields multiple generators from a single input iterable

** Reducing
    - built-in ~all(it)~
    - built-in ~any(it)~
    - built-in ~max(it, [key=,] [default=])~
    - built-in ~min(it, [key=,] [default=])~
    - functools ~reduce(func, it, [initial])~
    - built-in ~sum(it, start=0)~

** Others
    - ~count(start=0, step=1)~: indefinitely
      #+BEGIN_SRC python
        def aritprog_gen(begin, step, end=None):
            first = type(begin + step)(begin)
            ap_gen = itertools.count(first, step)
            if end is not None:
                ap_gen = itertools.takewhile(lambda n: n < end, ap_gen)
            return ap_gen
      #+END_SRC
    - ~cycle(it)~: indefinitely
    - ~repeat(item, [times])~: Yield the given item repeadedly, indefinetly unless a number of times is given
    - ~combinations(it, out_len)~: Yield combinations of /out_len/ items from the items yielded by it
    - ~combinations_with_replacement(it, out_len)~
    - ~permutations(it, out_len=None)~

** ~iter~ Tricks
   ~iter(callable, sentinel)~
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     def d6():
         return randint(1, 6)
     d6_iter = iter(d6, 1)  # the second argument is a sentinel

     # another useful example
     with open('mydata.txt') as fp:
         for line in iter(fp.readline, ''):
             process_line(line)
   #+END_SRC
   - when a sentinel returned by the callable, causes the iterator to *raise StopIteration* instead of *yielding the sentinel*.

* ~else~ keyword
** with ~for/while~
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     for item in my_list:
         if item.flavor == 'banana':
             break
     else:
         raise ValueError('No banana flavor found!')
   #+END_SRC

** with ~try~
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     try:
         dangerous_call()
     except OSError:
         log('OSError...')
     else:
         after_call()
   #+END_SRC

* Context Manager
  - The ~with~ statement was designed to simplify the try/finally pattern
  - ~__enter__()~~
  - ~__exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback)~: arguments are None, None, None if all went well

    - return True to tell the interpreter that the exception was handled.
    - If returns None or anything but True, any exception raised in the with block will be propagated.

** Novel Usages
   - Managing transactions in the sqlite3 module
   - Holding locks, conditions, and semaphores in threading code(RAII)
   - Setting up environments for arithmetic operations with Decimal objects
   - Applying temporary patches to objects for testing

** ~contextlib~
*** ~@contextmanager~ & ~@asynccontextmanager~
    A decorator that lets you build a context manager from a simple generator function, instead of creating a class and implementing the protocol.
    - Use ~yield~ to produce whatever you want the ~__enter__~ method to return
    - Essentially the contextlib.contextmanager decorator wraps the function in a class that implements the ~__enter__~ and ~__exit__~ methods.
    - ~__enter__~

      1. Invokes the generator function and holds on to the generator object—let's call it /gen/.
      2. Calls ~next(gen)~ to make it run to the ~yield~ keyword.
      3. Returns the value yielded by ~next(gen)~, so it can be bound to a target variable in the ~with/as~ form.

    - ~__exit__~

      1. Checks an exception was passed as ~exc_type~; if so, ~gen.throw(exception)~ is invoked, causing the exception to be raised in the yield line inside the generator function body.
      2. Otherwise, ~next(gen)~ is called, resuming the execution of the generator function body after the yield.

**** Tips
     - The ~__exit__~ method provided by the decorator assumes any exception sent into the generator is handled and should be suppressed.
     You must explicitly re-raise an exception in the decorated function if you don't want ~@contextmanager~ to suppress it.

     - Having a ~try/finally~ (or a ~with~ block) around the ~yield~ is an *unavoidable* price of using ~@contextmanager~,
     because you never know what the users of your context manager are going to do inside their with block.

**** Example
     A context manager for rewriting files in place
     #+BEGIN_SRC python
       import csv

       with inplace(csvfilename, 'r', newline='') as (infh, outfh):
           reader = csv.reader(infh)
           writer = csv.writer(outfh)

           for row in reader:
               row += ['new', 'columns']
               writer.writerow(row)
     #+END_SRC


*** closing
    A function to build context managers out of objects that provide a close() method but don’t implement the ~__enter__/__exit__~ protocol.
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      from contextlib import closing
      from urllib.request import urlopen

      with closing(urlopen('http://www.python.org')) as page:
          for line in page:
              print(line)
    #+END_SRC

*** suppress
    A context manager to temporarily ignore specified exceptions.
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      from contextlib import suppress

      with suppress(FileNotFoundError):
          os.remove('somefile.tmp')
    #+END_SRC

*** ContextDecorator
    A base class for defining class-based context managers that can also be used as function decorators, running the entire function within a managed context.
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      from contextlib import ContextDecorator
      class mycontext(ContextDecorator):
          def __enter__(self):
              print('Starting')
              return self

          def __exit__(self, *exc):
              print('Finishing')
              return False

      @mycontext()
      def function():
          print('The bit in the middle')
    #+END_SRC

*** ExitStack & AsyncExitStack
    A context manager that lets you enter a variable number of context managers. When the with block ends, ExitStack calls the stacked context managers' ~__exit__~ methods in LIFO order
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      with ExitStack() as stack:
          files = [stack.enter_context(open(fname)) for fname in filenames]
          # All opened files will automatically be closed at the end of
          # the with statement, even if attempts to open files later
          # in the list raise an exception
    #+END_SRC

*** others
   - ~redirect_stdout~, ~redirect_stderr~

* Coroutine
  - Generators produce data for iteration
  - Coroutines are consumers of data
  - To keep your brain from exploding, you don't mix the two concepts together
  - Coroutines are not related to iteration
  - ~.send()~ allows two-way data exchange between the client code and the generator in contrast with ~.__next__()~

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
    def simple_coroutine():
        print('-> coroutine started')
        x = yield # received by send(x)
        print('-> coroutine received:', x)

    coro = simple_coroutine() # GEN_CREATED
    next(coro) # equivalent to coro.send(None). GEN_CREATED->GEN_RUNNING->GEN_SUSPENDED
    #-> coroutine started
    coro.send(42) # GEN_SUSPENDED->GEN_RUNNING->GEN_CLOSED
    #-> coroutine received: 42
  #+END_SRC
  - next(coro) is often describe as "priming" the coroutine(advancing it to the first yield)

** states
   use ~inspect.getgeneratorstate()~ to get state
   - GEN_CREATED: Waiting to start execution
   - GEN_RUNNING: Currently being executed by the interpreter
   - GEN_SUSPENDED: Currently suspended at a yield expression
   - GEN_CLOSED

** auto priming
** Termination & Exception
*** from generator
    An exception within a coroutine propagates to the caller of the next or send that triggered it.
*** to generator
    - ~throw~: Causes the yield expression where the generator was paused to raise the exception given.
    - ~close~: Causes the yield expression where the generator was paused to raise a Generator Exit exception.
*** cleanup code
    wrap the cleanup code in ~try/finally~ block

** return value
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     Result = namedtuple('Result', 'count average')
     def averager():
         total = 0.0
         count = 0
         average = None
         while True:
             term = yield # yield None
             if term is None:
                 break # use a sentinel to terminate the coroutine normally
             total += term
             count += 1
             average = total/count
         return Result(count, average)

     coro_avg = averager()
     coro_avg.send(10)
     try:
         coro_avg.send(None)
     except StopIteration as exc:
         result = exc.value # Result(count=3, average=15.5)
   #+END_SRC
   - in order to return a value, a coroutine must terminate normally

** *yield from*
   The main feature of *yield from* is to open a bidirectional channel from the outermost caller to the innermost subgenerator, so that values
   can be sent and yielded back and forth directly from them, and exceptions can be thrown all the way in without adding a lot of exception
   handling boilerplate code in the intermediate coroutines.

   - similar constructs in other languages are called *await*
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     def gen():
         yield from 'abc'
         # shortcut for forloop
         # for x in 'abc':
         #     yield x
   #+END_SRC
*** terms
    - delegating generator: The generator function that contains the *yield from <iterable>* expression
    - subgenerator
    - caller

    #+CAPTION: Coroutine
    #+ATTR_HTML: align="center"
    file:../resources/python/coroutine.png

*** meaning of *yield from*
**** Any values that the subgenerator yields are passed directly to the caller of the delegating generator
**** Any values sent to the delegating generator using *send()* are passed directly to the subgenerator.

    If the sent value is *None*, the subgenerator's *__next__()* method is called. If the sent value is
    not *None*, the subgenerator's *send()* method is called. If the call raises *StopIteration*, the delegating
    generator is resumed. Any other exception is propagated to the delegating generator.

**** return expr in a generator (or subgenerator) causes *StopIteration(expr)* to be raised upon exit from the generator.
**** The value of the *yield from* expression is the first argument to the *StopIteration* exception raised by the subgenerator when it terminates.

*** pseudocode
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
      _i = iter(EXPR)
      try:
          _y = next(_i)
      except StopIteration as _e:
          _r = _e.value # the RESULT in the simplest case
      else: # channel between the caller and the subgenerator
          while 1:
              _s = yield _y
              try:
                  _y = _i.send(_s)
              except StopIteration as _e:
                  _r = _e.value
                  break
      RESULT = _r
    #+END_SRC
    - _i(iterator): The subgenerator
    - _y(yielded): A value yielded from the subgenerator
    - _r(result): The eventual result
    - _s(sent): A value sent by the caller to the delegating generator, which is forwarded to the subgenerator
    - _e(exception): An exception
